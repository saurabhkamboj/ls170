Protocols are system of rules.
What is network? At the most basic level, it is two devices connected in such a way that they can communicate and exchange data. A primitive way to do this would be to connect two devices using a LAN cable. LAN stands for local area network (Multiple devices are connected using a hub or in mordern times a switch). Routers basically add as gateway into or out of networks, they enable routing of network traffic to other networks.

Protocols are the set of rules that govern the exchange or transmission of data.

PDU - Protocol data unit

Latency is the measure of time it takes for some data to get from one point in a network to another point in a network (Could be thought of as the measure of delay). Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be sent in a particular unit of time, mostly a second.

TCP - Transmission control protocol
